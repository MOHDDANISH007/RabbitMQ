# What is RabbitMQ

## 🧠 Think of RabbitMQ like a post office

- You (the sender) put a message (like a letter) into the post office
- The post office (RabbitMQ) stores it temporarily
- Then it delivers the message to the right receiver (the consumer) when they're ready

## 💬 In technical terms

- **Producer** → the sender that creates and sends messages
- **Queue** → where RabbitMQ stores messages until a consumer takes them
- **Consumer** → the receiver that reads and processes the messages

## ⚙️ Example

Imagine an e-commerce app:

1. When a user places an order, the order service sends a message: "Order #123 created"
2. RabbitMQ stores it in a queue
3. The email service later receives it and sends a confirmation email

This way, both services work independently — even if the email service is down for a while, RabbitMQ keeps the message safe.

## 💡 Why use RabbitMQ?

- ✅ Helps handle large loads (messages can wait in a queue)
- ✅ Prevents data loss (messages are saved until delivered)
- ✅ Allows systems to be decoupled (they don't have to talk directly)
- ✅ Works across different languages (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.)

## 🧩 RabbitMQ Components

### 1️⃣ Producer

The sender of messages.

- It creates and sends messages to RabbitMQ
- 📦 **Example:** An "Order Service" sends a message → "New order placed"

### 2️⃣ Exchange

The dispatcher inside RabbitMQ.

- It receives messages from producers and decides where to send them (to which queue)
- Think of it like a mail sorter in a post office

**There are 4 types of exchanges:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Direct | Sends messages to a queue with a matching key | "info" messages go to the "info" queue |
| Fanout | Sends messages to all queues connected to it | Send notifications to all users |
| Topic | Sends based on pattern matching | Routing key: user.signup matches user.* |
| Headers | Uses message headers (metadata) to route | Based on header values instead of routing keys |

### 3️⃣ Queue

A storage box that holds messages until a consumer reads them.

- Messages wait here if the consumer is busy or offline
- 📬 **Example:** The "email_queue" stores "Send email to user" messages

### 4️⃣ Binding

A link between an exchange and a queue.

- It tells the exchange which queue should receive which messages
- 📎 **Example:**
  - Exchange: logs_exchange
  - Queue: error_queue
  - Binding key: error → Only "error" messages go to that queue

### 5️⃣ Consumer

The receiver of messages.

- It listens to a queue and processes messages one by one
- 🧠 **Example:** The "Email Service" reads messages from "email_queue" and sends real emails

### 6️⃣ Connection

A network link between the producer/consumer and RabbitMQ server.

- 🌐 **Example:** Your Node.js or Python app connects to RabbitMQ using TCP

### 7️⃣ Channel

A virtual connection inside a single connection.

- Used to send multiple messages without opening new network links
- 🧩 **Example:** One app connection can handle many queues using separate channels

### 8️⃣ Virtual Host (vHost)

Like a workspace or namespace inside RabbitMQ.

- Helps separate different apps or environments
- 🏠 **Example:** One vHost for "testing", another for "production"

### 9️⃣ Message

The actual data being sent — the content.

It has two parts:
- **Header** (metadata like routing key, priority, etc.)
- **Body** (the real message content)

✉️ **Example:**
- Header → key = "email"
- Body → "Send welcome email to user@example.com"

## 🧩 What is a Topic Exchange?

A **Topic Exchange** routes messages to one or more queues based on **patterns** in the routing key.

👉 It's like a "smart filter" that delivers messages only to the queues that match a certain pattern.

### 🧠 Think of it like this:

- You have many types of news — sports, weather, and politics
- You only want to subscribe to messages (news) that match your interest
- The Topic Exchange makes that possible!

### 📬 How it works:

1. **Producer** sends a message with a **routing key** (a string with words separated by dots `.`)
   
   **Examples:**
   - `india.weather.rain`
   - `sports.cricket.india`

2. **Queues** are bound to the Topic Exchange using **binding keys** (patterns)
   
   These patterns use:
   - `*` → matches exactly one word
   - `#` → matches zero or more words

### 🧾 Example Setup:

Let's say we have a Topic Exchange called `news_exchange`.

**Queues:**
- **Queue 1** → wants all cricket news
  - Binding key: `sports.cricket.*`
- **Queue 2** → wants all Indian news
  - Binding key: `*.india.#`

**Messages sent by producer:**

| Routing Key | Message | Goes to which queue? |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| `sports.cricket.india` | "India won the match!" | ✅ Queue 1 and ✅ Queue 2 |
| `sports.football.uk` | "England scored a goal!" | ❌ Queue 1 ❌ Queue 2 |
| `india.weather.rain` | "It's raining in Delhi." | ✅ Queue 2 only |

### 🧠 Pattern Summary:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `*` | Matches one word | `sports.*` → matches `sports.cricket`, `sports.hockey` |
| `#` | Matches many words | `india.#` → matches `india.weather.rain`, `india.news.politics` |

### ✅ Why use Topic Exchange?

- Flexible message routing
- Ideal for publish/subscribe systems
- Allows filtering messages by categories or types

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
npm install amqplib
```

## 📝 Code Examples

### Publisher (publisher.js)

```javascript
// publisher.js
import amqp from "amqplib";

const exchangeName = "news_exchange";

const sendMessage = async () => {
  try {
    // 1️⃣ Connect to RabbitMQ
    const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
    const channel = await connection.createChannel();

    // 2️⃣ Assert (create) a Topic Exchange
    await channel.assertExchange(exchangeName, "topic", { durable: false });

    // 3️⃣ Messages with different routing keys
    const messages = [
      { key: "sports.cricket.india", text: "India won the cricket match!" },
      { key: "sports.football.uk", text: "England scored a goal!" },
      { key: "india.weather.rain", text: "It's raining in Delhi!" }
    ];

    // 4️⃣ Publish messages
    messages.forEach(msg => {
      channel.publish(exchangeName, msg.key, Buffer.from(msg.text));
      console.log(`📤 Sent: "${msg.text}" with key "${msg.key}"`);
    });

    setTimeout(() => {
      connection.close();
      process.exit(0);
    }, 500);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
};

sendMessage();
```

### Consumer (subscriber.js)

This file listens to messages based on specific topic patterns.

```javascript
// subscriber.js
import amqp from "amqplib";

const exchangeName = "news_exchange";

const startConsumer = async () => {
  try {
    const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
    const channel = await connection.createChannel();

    await channel.assertExchange(exchangeName, "topic", { durable: false });

    // 1️⃣ Create a temporary queue
    const q = await channel.assertQueue("", { exclusive: true });

    // 2️⃣ Bind queue with topic patterns
    const bindingKeys = ["sports.cricket.*", "*.india.#"];
    for (const key of bindingKeys) {
      await channel.bindQueue(q.queue, exchangeName, key);
    }

    console.log("✅ Waiting for messages...");

    // 3️⃣ Consume messages
    channel.consume(q.queue, msg => {
      console.log(`📩 Received (${msg.fields.routingKey}): ${msg.content.toString()}`);
    }, { noAck: true });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
};

startConsumer();
```

## 🧪 How to Run

In two separate terminals:

**Terminal 1:** Run the consumer
```bash
node subscriber.js
```

**Terminal 2:** Run the producer
```bash
node publisher.js
```

## 🧾 Expected Output

**Consumer Terminal:**
```
✅ Waiting for messages...
📩 Received (sports.cricket.india): India won the cricket match!
📩 Received (india.weather.rain): It's raining in Delhi!
```

<!-- What is Fanout Exchange? -->

## 🧩 What is a Fanout Exchange?

A **Fanout Exchange** is the simplest type of exchange in RabbitMQ. It sends (broadcasts) every message it receives to **all queues** that are bound to it — no routing key is needed!

### 🧠 Think of it like this:

Imagine a loudspeaker 🎤 in a room — whatever message you speak goes to everyone (all listeners) at the same time.

1. **Producer** → sends message to the Fanout Exchange
2. **Fanout Exchange** → copies that message to every connected queue
3. **Consumers** → each get a copy of the message

### 🧾 Example Scenario

Let's say you have a system that sends notifications.

You want to send the same message — **"🚨 Server is down!"** — to multiple services:

- Email Service
- SMS Service  
- Logging Service

Instead of sending it separately to each one, you just publish once to a Fanout Exchange, and RabbitMQ delivers it to all queues automatically.

### ⚙️ Data Flow Diagram

```
Producer → [Fanout Exchange] → Queue1 → Consumer1 (Email)
                             → Queue2 → Consumer2 (SMS)  
                             → Queue3 → Consumer3 (Logger)
```

All three consumers receive the same message.

### ✅ When to use a Fanout Exchange

Use it when:

- You want to broadcast messages to multiple systems
- You don't care about message filtering or routing keys

**Common use cases:**
- System-wide notifications
- Event broadcasting
- Real-time updates

---

## 💻 Fanout Exchange Code Examples

### 🛠️ Installation

Make sure RabbitMQ is running and install the library:

```bash
npm install amqplib
```

### 📝 Producer (publisher.js)

```javascript
// publisher.js
import amqp from "amqplib";

const exchangeName = "logs_exchange";

const sendMessage = async () => {
  try {
    const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
    const channel = await connection.createChannel();

    // Create a Fanout exchange
    await channel.assertExchange(exchangeName, "fanout", { durable: false });

    const message = "🚨 Server is down!";
    channel.publish(exchangeName, "", Buffer.from(message));

    console.log(`📤 Sent message: ${message}`);

    setTimeout(() => {
      connection.close();
      process.exit(0);
    }, 500);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
};

sendMessage();
```

### 📝 Consumer (subscriber.js)

```javascript
// subscriber.js
import amqp from "amqplib";

const exchangeName = "logs_exchange";

const startConsumer = async (serviceName) => {
  try {
    const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
    const channel = await connection.createChannel();

    // Create same Fanout exchange
    await channel.assertExchange(exchangeName, "fanout", { durable: false });

    // Create a temporary queue
    const q = await channel.assertQueue("", { exclusive: true });

    // Bind queue to the Fanout exchange (no routing key)
    await channel.bindQueue(q.queue, exchangeName, "");

    console.log(`✅ [${serviceName}] Waiting for messages...`);

    channel.consume(q.queue, msg => {
      if (msg.content) {
        console.log(`📩 [${serviceName}] Received: ${msg.content.toString()}`);
      }
    }, { noAck: true });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
};

// Start multiple consumers
startConsumer("Email Service");
startConsumer("SMS Service");
startConsumer("Logging Service");
```

### 🧪 How to Run the Fanout Example

Open two terminals:

**Terminal 1:** Run the consumer
```bash
node subscriber.js
```

**Terminal 2:** Run the producer
```bash
node publisher.js
```

### 🧾 Expected Output

**Consumer Terminal:**
```
✅ [Email Service] Waiting for messages...
✅ [SMS Service] Waiting for messages...
✅ [Logging Service] Waiting for messages...
📩 [Email Service] Received: 🚨 Server is down!
📩 [SMS Service] Received: 🚨 Server is down!
📩 [Logging Service] Received: 🚨 Server is down!
```
